Hi, I'm Andrew! I'm a software engineer living in the SF Bay Area.

ðŸ’¼ I've been in the industry for 6 years doing <b>fullstack and mobile development, product engineering, and machine learning</b>. I'm currently a fullstack engineer at Meta on the Dating team. Before that I was a backend engineer on the Misinformation team, and even before that I was a ranking engineer on the Groups Integrity team. I also had a brief stint at Microsoft working on facial recognition on the Windows Hello team!

ðŸŽµ I've been playing piano for most of my life and have been dabbling in music production for the last 5 years, mostly using Ableton Live. I like making house remixes and original beats!

âœ¨ I also enjoy bouldering (currently V4-6), discovering new board games to play with friends (I recommend Werewords), hoarding Snoopys (ask me about my collection), and looking at videos of shrimp (r/shrimptank)!

Cheers!
